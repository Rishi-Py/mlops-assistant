# MLOps Assistant – Product Vision & Demo Brief

## 🎯 Vision

Enable the machine learning teams to build, deploy, monitor, and manage ML workflows using natural language prompts — reducing friction, improving velocity, and democratizing access to ML infrastructure.

## 🧠 Core Idea

> "A ChatGPT-like interface where any data scientist or ML engineer can type:  
> *'Train a regression model on this dataset'*  
> *'Deploy to staging'*  
> *'Fix missing data'*  
> *'Check for model drift'* — and it just happens."

## 🧪 Demo Scope

### Live Flow (Tomorrow's Demo)
- Upload dataset (`titanic.csv`)
- Drop non-numeric columns
- Fix missing data
- Train regression model
- Log experiment
- Deploy model to staging
- Monitor model performance
- Provision GPU (simulated)

### Features Demonstrated
- Prompt interface (Streamlit)
- Agent-powered tool routing (LangChain)
- Data pipeline tools
- Deployment & infra simulation
- Metrics & logs view
- Download processed dataset

## 🗺️ Near-Term Product Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Rule-based tools for training, cleaning, deployment
- Logs, metrics, downloads
- Modular codebase (`app_chat.py`, `app_agent.py`)

### Phase 2: Real MLOps
- Containerized infra (Docker)
- Model registry + versioning (MLflow/DVC)
- Real deployment pipelines (GitHub Actions)

### Phase 3: Agent Autonomy
- LangChain ReAct agent with tool selection
- Prompt memory, auto-fixing errors
- UI/UX evolution with Plotly Dash or custom frontend

## 🧑‍💼 Target Users

- ML engineers and DS teams in enterprises
- Platform teams building MLOps internal tools
- Consultants automating ML workflows

## 📌 Differentiators

- Prompt-first experience (not code, not YAML)
- Modular, extensible, real backend
- Designed for integration with real MLOps stacks
